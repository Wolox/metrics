# @wolox/js-test-coverage-script

This package is made for retrieve test coverage metrics from lvcov report generated by running test:coverage command, and make a file called `code_coverage.json` on your root project folder.

## Installation

Use npm to install into your project

```bash
npm i --also=dev @wolox/js-test-coverage-script
```

## Usage

Add the following into to your project `package.json` inside the `scripts` key
(example for react projects, modify rescripts for your need, keep these options `--watchAll=false --silent --coverageThreshold '{}' --coverageReporters='json-summary'`):

```json
"test:generate-coverage-file": "node ./node_modules/@wolox/js-test-coverage-script",
"test:coverage": "rescripts test --env=jsdom --coverage --passWithNoTests --watchAll=false --silent --coverageThreshold '{}' --coverageReporters='json-summary' && npm run test:generate-coverage-file"
```

The last step is to attach the `test:coverage` script to husky hook `pre-commit` (Note this is important because we should retrieve coverage for every commit change, and should be the last step to run):

```json
"pre-commit": "'...your pre-commit config' && npm run test:coverage",
```

The final result is that your changes into `code_coverage.json` will be auto-added into your commit, then push as you normally do.
