#Â GIT metrics

A utility to calculate GIT metrics.

## Installation

To install the package:

```bash
npm install @wolox/git-metrics
```

## Usage

This package returns a single function. This function is a sort of factory that given a provider and a authToken will return the metric fetcher generator. 

### Parameters

```js
const gitMetrics = require('git-metrics');

const accessToken = 'a valid access token from your provider'
const getGithubMetrics = gitMetrics('github', accessToken);

getGithubMetrics(repositoryName, organizationName).then(metrics => {
  // Use or save your metrics
});

```

- Default export (`gitMetrics`) in the example above

|Parameter|Description|
|----|-----------|
|provider|The git provider. For the time being we only support `github` and `gitlab`|
|authToken|A personal access token to obtain data from the provider. For github it must have full `repo` permissions, while for `gitlab` it must have `read_api` permissions|

- Default export's return value (`getGithubMetrics` in the example)

|Parameter|Description|
|----|-----------|
|repositoryName|The git repository's name|
|organizationName|For `github`, this must be the organization's name, but for `gitlab` this must be the repository's whole path with namespace, but without the repository name. For example, if your repo's path is `google/google-drive/google-sheets` this parameter should be `google/google-drive`|

### Return value

The return value consists of a list of the PRs that were closed in the last 14 days. Each with their respective pick up time and code review time.

```js
[
  { 
    review_time: 20
    pick_up_time: 10
  },
  { 
    review_time: 5
    pick_up_time: 2
  }
]
```

For the time being we support the following metrics:

- `review_time`: Time (in hours) between the PR/MR is created and merged
- `pick_up_time`: Time (in hours) between the PR/MR is created and it's first reviewed

**Note**: Metric values can return `undefined`. You should handle that scenario on your own.
